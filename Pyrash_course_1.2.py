# 1-2. Hello World Typos: Open the hello_world.py(Pyrash_course_1.0.py in this instance)
# file you just created. Make a typo somewhere in the line and run the program again.
# Can you make a typo that generates an error? Can you make sense of the error message?
# Can you make a typo that doesn’t generate an error?
# Why do you think it didn’t make an error?

"""In programming a "typo" is more like a mistake in grammar of a language. its not directly directed
to guys wwith blood type O :D,
Here we are simply asked to make a mistake in our syntax that the intepreter will raise an ERROR
and another tolerable error that wont raise any flags.

# PROGRAM WITH A TYPO THAT GENERATES AN ERROR
    print("Hello, Python World!")

# PROGRAM WITH A TYPO THAT DOESN'T GENERATE AN ERROR
print   ("Hello, Python World!")


# I HOPE I GOT THIS RIGHT

"""
Here we are being asked to tackle variables, remember variables are like stores, so we store the
value inside a variable and we keep calling the variable whenever we want the value printed instead
of inserting a long statement inside the function/method's parentheses for the many times we are
asked to print it, It woruld really be tiresome and we don't like repeating ourselves.
NOTE: Variable values can be changed AND once changed, its gone permanently.
Same way as once you've stored certain things in your store and eventually replaced
them with others. They like gone and now your store has completely different values.

    # CHALLENGE:
        # Write a program that outputs "Hello, Python World!"


"""
APPROACH:
You simply have to call/use a "print()" method/function and inside its parenthesis,
add whatever you wish/desire/want printed out BUT considering first its type. 
And in this case we have a STRING, "Hello, Python world".
(Same applies to other data types)
"""

# PROGRAM
print("Hello, Python World!")



# TAKE AWAY
print("You are going to be number") #string
print(1) #Integer
print("in 1000 python snakes. ") #string with numbers in it
